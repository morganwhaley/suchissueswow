Build a simple interactive UI to display a list of a user-specified arbitrary organization's Github projects ranked by any meaningful metric you'd like, and allow the user to browse recent commits on that project.

### Up and Running!
This project was built without npm, yarn, or any type of framework. This is delicious vanilla JS with some jQuery sprinkles for helping helpfulness.

To get going, simply load `index.html` in your favorite browser.

### Here is a Shiba Inu GIF
Just because.
